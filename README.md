TASK:

Please write in Python using OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Keras libraries a code that recognizes three different fruits (banana, orange, lemon) in the image. The following points should be included:
1. Prepare a training set using basic graphic operations. The set must consist of at least 450 photos and descriptors.
2. Design a convolutional neural network (with intermediate maxpooling layers)
3. Propose proper activation functions
4. Optimize the network. 
5. Perform a test classification
